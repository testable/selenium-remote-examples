Selenium Remote Examples
------------------------

Example code for running a Selenium test against the Testable remote grid. Examples for the <a target="_blank" href="https://webdriver.io">Webdriver.io</a> Selenium client library and for Selenium Java included here though this can be adapted to any Selenium bindings.

### Steps to Run: Webdriver.io

1. Set your API key: `export TESTABLE_KEY=xxx`. API keys can be generated by logging into Testable and going to Org Management => API Keys.
2. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies in the `wdio` directory.
3. Choose the example you want to run and use the embedded `wdio`. For example: `./node_modules/.bin/wdio 01-chrome-latest-shared-region.conf.js` to run the basic example.

The examples include an `assertion-reporter.js` Webdriver.io reporter that reports the test steps back to Testable as assertions that can be seen along side the test results.

### Steps to Run: Java

1. Make sure you have Gradle and Java 8+ installed.
2. Set your API key: `export TESTABLE_KEY=xxx`. API keys can be generated by logging into Testable and going to Org Management => API Keys.
3. From the `java` directory on the command line execute `gradle run`.

This should run your test against Testable's remote selenium grid.
